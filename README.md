# Teck stack and tools

**Development tools**

- Javascript ecosystem [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v14.5+
- Dependency management [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/)
- Preferred IDE [Visual Studio Code](https://reactjs.org/), make sure you download the latest versions with the following extensions installed

**Frameworks and main dependencies**

- [graphql](https://reactjs.org/)
- [firebase](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

**Other dev dependencies**

- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) We do not use plain Javascript. Typescripts allows us to catch errors and provide fixes before we run the code.
- [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) nice linter to enforce our code hygene rules
- babel
- yarn

# How to run the app on your machine

- Make sure you install all the tools specified in the previous section.
- clone the repository in your machine
- Make sure you save in a safe folder. **DO NOT GIVE ACCESS TO ANYONE NOT INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT**
- open your terminal or command line pointing to the project root folder (where `package.json` is located)
- run `yarn` to install all dependencies

`yarn start`

If the app does not behave properly i.e not loading and reporting errors, it might be due to an unstable bundler. You can clean the cache and reinstall all dependencies by running

`yarn clean`

# Libraries and usage

Here we will list all the libraries used in the app. To be updated.

# Conventions and code hygene

As we work we find ourselve agreeing on some conventions. They should all go here.
